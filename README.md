# LangLern

**LangLern** is an AI-enhanced language learning app that combines the power of **data science** and **basic AI models** to personalize your journey in mastering new languages. Currently in development, LangLern aims to make language acquisition smarter, adaptive, and engaging — whether you're a beginner or brushing up fluency.

## 🚀 Project Idea

LangLern is being developed as a language learning platform with these core ideas:

- **Data-Driven Personalization**: Analyze user progress and optimize learning paths using data science techniques.
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: Use basic natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary in real time.
- **Engagement-First Design**: Provide smart reminders, adaptive quizzes, and gamified elements that adjust to the learner’s behavior and goals.
- **Modular Skill Building**: Break language into micro-skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) and let users grow them organically.

LangLern is currently in its **early development phase**. We are experimenting with AI integrations, data structures for tracking learning metrics, and an intuitive UI/UX tailored for long-term habit building.

## 🔧 Key Features (in-developemnt)

- AI feedback on pronunciation and sentence structure.
- Personalized daily learning plan with spaced repetition.
- Real-time analytics on learning performance and vocabulary retention.
- Beginner-to-advanced content built dynamically from learner data.
